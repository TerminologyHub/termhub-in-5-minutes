# Termhub in 5 Minutes Tutorial

This is an easy-to-use tutorial for accessing TermHub APIs through api.terminologyhub.com.
[TermHub](https://www.terminologyhub.com) is a cloud healthcare terminology server offering 
access to a large library of code systems, value sets, and concept mappings along with standard 
developer-friendly mechansims for interacting with that content (such as FHIRÂ® terminology services).

## Use Cases

The following cases will be used to demonstrate accessing the TermHub Terminology API.  These are
the standard kinds of questions that a terminology server supports for interacting with code systems.

- Login
- Get terminologies
- Get project terminologies
- Get specific terminology
- Export terminology
- Get concept by code
- Get concept by code with explicit include parameter
- Get concept relationships by code
- Get concept inverse relationships by code
- Get concept trees
- Find concepts by search term (use paging to get only first 5 results)
- Find concepts by search term with explicit include parameter
- Find concepts by search term and expression
- Find terms by search term
- Support autocomplete/typeahead for first few characters typed
- Get mapsets
- Get project mapsets
- Get specific mapset
- Export mapset
- Get mappings for concept by code
- Find project mappings for mapset
- Find project mappings
- Coming Soon: compute "new" or "retired" codes across terminology versions

All of the tutorials use an environment variable for the API URL of the deployment:

- API_URL=https://api.terminologyhub.com
